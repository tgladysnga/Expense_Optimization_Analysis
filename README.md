# Expense Optimization and Customer Churn Analysis

# Goal
The purpose of this project is to help optimize marketing expenses for the analytical team of a company. We are going to study how people use the product when they start to buy, how much money each customer brings, and when they pay off. We will also analyze customer churn and retention. We can then use the analysis to advise marketing experts on how much money to invest and where.

# Metrics Calculated
- **CAC** - Customer Acquisition Cost
- **LTV** - Customer Lifetime Value
- **ROI** - Return on Investment
- **ROMI** - Return on Marketing Investment
